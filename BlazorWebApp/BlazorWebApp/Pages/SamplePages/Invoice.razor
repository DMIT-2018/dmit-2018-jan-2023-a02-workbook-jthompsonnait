    ***  OnSubmit *** 
-   The OnSubmit event fires when the user clicks on the Submit button the the form.
    Its handler takes as an argument the EditContext object and is used to trigger
        some custom logic based io the validity of the form.
NOTE:   When there is a handler for the OnSubmit event, the OnValidSubmit and 
            OnInvalidSubmit events will not be fired.
            
    *** OnValidSubmit ***
-   The OnValidSubmit event fires when the form is submitted and there are no 
        validations errors.
    It is mapped to OnValidSubmit event of the Microsoft EditForm.  Its handler takes
        the EditContext as an argument.
        
    ***  OnInvalidSubmit ***
    -   The OnInvalidSubmit event fires when there are validation errors in the form
            upon it submission
        It is mapped to OnInvalidSbmit event of the Microsoft EditForm.  Its handler
        takes the EditContext as an argument
        

NOTE:   We can use not of these events or one of these events.  The only situation where
            we can use two events is when we set
                OnValidSubmit and OnInValidSubmit together.  Neither of those two
                events can ve consumed if the OnSUbmit is set.
